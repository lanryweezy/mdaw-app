## Test Data

Tests use mock data and file paths to avoid dependencies on actual audio files. This ensures:
- Fast test execution
- Consistent test results
- No external file dependencies
- Easy CI/CD integration

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed to run in CI/CD environments:
- No external dependencies
- Deterministic results
- Comprehensive coverage
- Fast execution time

## Adding New Tests

When adding new features to the app:

1. **Add unit tests** for new view models and services
2. **Add widget tests** for new UI components
3. **Add screen tests** for new screens
4. **Add integration tests** for new user flows
5. **Update this README** with new test descriptions

## Test Best Practices

- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Use setUp and tearDown for test preparation
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain high test coverage
